# REST Client Samples

When developing in modern tools, you must often work with REST API's. This is
especially true when working with a public cloud platform, like
[Microsoft Azure](https://microsoft.com/azure).

Since I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my primary tool for
writing scripts, I have been using an extension called
[REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
for working with REST API's.  This tool allows me to write simple scripts of
my HTTP calls, which can be easily shared with others!

This repository contains some snippets of `.http` script files that
illustrate common tasks in the Azure world.
